    <h1>This is a summary of the findings and connections made by the SAMHSA's National Survey on 
    Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)</h1>
    <p id="p1"> Survey Sample Size and Age of Participating Individuals: <br> </p>
    <p>For this survey, a sample size of radomly chosen 70,000 people age 12 and over was used.(As stated on https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/project_description.html)<br></p>
    <p id="p1"> Data Set Findings and Statistics: <br> </p>
    The results found many interesting statistics, and the data statistic that jumped out at me, <br>
    but unsuprisingly, was that the highest percentages of substance use, abuse, and dependence <br>
    were in the 18-25 age group. I believe this showcases the prominent drug and alchohol abuse problems facing America's youth. <br>
